## My Writing for the Team Teach

Open systems Interconnect is a protocol model in which information can be transferred between the network. 


Last part of the video notes:

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):
Reliable Delivery: TCP makes sure that data sent between devices arrives safely and in the right order.
Connection Setup: Before sending data, TCP sets up a connection between devices.
Checks and Corrections: It double-checks to confirm data is sent and received correctly. If anything gets lost, it sends it again.
Efficiency: It controls how fast data moves so that a fast sender doesn't overwhelm a slow receiver.


TCP guarantees the safe and ordered delivery of data, similar to a registered mail service. It's often used for applications like web browsing, email, file transfer, and etc. 

Made the popcorn hacks.
